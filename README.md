# Portfolio Optimizer: An Exploratory Journey

In this project, I build an optimal portfolio using the Black-Litterman model and the Efficient Frontier concept. I aim to merge market data with personal viewpoints on expected stock returns, creating a balanced blend of market consensus and individual perspective.

## Objective

The goal is to incorporate market equilibrium returns with personal beliefs about future stock performance. The result is a set of optimized returns that harmonize market consensus with personal insights.

## Approach

- **Data Collection**: The project begins with the gathering of historical stock data using yfinance for a predetermined set of ticker symbols.

- **Data Processing**: The raw data undergoes transformation into essential statistics and indicators, serving as the foundation for further analysis.

- **Black-Litterman Model**: The centerpiece of this project is the Black-Litterman model, enabling me to incorporate personal views about the expected returns of each stock. This addition gives a unique personal flavor to the portfolio optimization process.

- **Efficient Frontier**: The concept of the Efficient Frontier is employed to identify the optimal portfolios. These portfolios offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk, or the least risk for a given level of expected return.
